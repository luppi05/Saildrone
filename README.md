# Saildrone Simulation

This project simulates a Saildrone moving through a set of waypoints using aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces.

# How to run first task:
python3 simulate.py

# How to run extension task:
python3 extension_simulate.py


# Main files
- `extension_simulate.py` — runs the simulation and plots the trajectory for extension task
- `extension_programme.py` — dynamics and control for extension task
- `my_functions.py` — functions that are needed throughou
- `saildrone_hydro.py` — hydrodynamic forces  
- `saildrone_hydro.dat` — hydrodynamic lookup data  
- `ode.py` — ODE solver
- `programme.py` - dynamics and control for first task
- `simulate.py` - simulates and plots trajectory for first task
